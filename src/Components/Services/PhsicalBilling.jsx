Our claim management system has a procedure for sorting out old accounts receivable so that we may collect the most money possible from them. Many times, all that is required is a basic explanation of what the payment is for and the proper notification of the relevant person, whether it be the payer or the patient them self. We streamline the medical billing process as a physician billing firm, which lowers costs and increases revenue collection.
