                <h2>Comprehensive Laboratory Billing Solutions</h2>
                <p>Unlike many medical billing companies that only service high-ticket providers, Trivium MBS’s innovative approach works perfectly for lab billing solutions where a high volume of low-dollar claims need to be processed. The efficiency of our system allows us to quickly scrub and file hundreds of claims, typically within 48 hours, and includes a manager assigned to each client who will track all claims, making sure each one gets reimbursed.

              <h3>EHR/EMR Integration</h3>
              <p> In order to avoid claim denials due to coding errors, software must be updated frequently—however, the cost of maintaining this kind of an information system can be prohibitive for labs. One of the greatest benefits of working with an independent laboratory billing services & solutions company is that you no longer have to worry about keeping up with coding changes and payer requirements.

                Our software can be integrated with your existing practice management, EHR and EMR programs, or it can be used alone to encompass all aspects of patient data and revenue management.</p>

                <p>The coding and billing teams at Trivium MBS are highly trained and experienced, but ongoing training is part of our business model, to keep everyone up to date on code changes and new payer requirements. A final step in our claims management process that helps us really stand out is tracking down the source of the error that caused the rejection or denial, and re-training the responsible party to make sure errors are not repeated. So, our lab billing solutions can optimize your billing process substantially.</p>

          {/* <p className=' text-center'>A tremendous amount of revenue is lost every year due to unpaid claims not being managed properly. We have a dedicated AR recovery team that is extremely successful at getting reimbursements for what others consider “uncollectible.” It is well known in the collections industry that the longer a bill goes unpaid, the less likely it is to be paid—but rather than giving up on old AR recovery & bills. Our account receivables services team takes that as our cue to take immediate action towards identifying and investigating every unpaid claim. Few medical AR billing services are willing to take on aging AR, or if they do, they want a high fee. Our system streamlines the process, allowing us to be efficient enough to work profitably on old AR Recoveries and low-value claims. These are some of the features of our AR recovery system.</p> */}
